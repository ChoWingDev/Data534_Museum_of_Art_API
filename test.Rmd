```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## test

```{r cars}
library(TheMetR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# 1) Search
s <- met_search("monet", has_images = TRUE)

# 2) Fetch objects (sample first N for speed)
ids <- head(s$object_id, 50)
objs <- met_objects(ids)

# 3) Clean for plotting (keep valid years)
plot_df <- objs %>%
  filter(!is.na(object_end_date)) %>%
  mutate(object_end_date = as.numeric(object_end_date))

# 4) Plot: histogram of end year
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = object_end_date)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  labs(
    title = "The Met Collection: Monet Search Results (Sample)",
    x = "Object end year",
    y = "Count"
  )

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
